# About FizViz
FizViz is a system for creating physical visualizations of analytics and data. We created the platform as part of the World's Largest Arduino Challenge on hackster.io. You can read all about it on hackster at:

# This Repo
This repository contains an EAGLE schematic for the basic wiring of the Arduino and breakout boards used in the system. If you don't have EAGLE, don't worry - we will always post a .PNG of the latest schematic to the repo as well.
